Hello world ! My name is Austin. Working on projects that satisify my longing to learn how things are made would be the most entertaining thing for me to do. Weather it's learning how to create a messaging app or discovering the details in creating frame by frame soundwave manipulation known as wavetables, discovery is my fuel. I love details about the projects I work on instead of just glazing the top layer of workflows.
